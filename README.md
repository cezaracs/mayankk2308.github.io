# Mayank Kumar
Welcome to my portfolio! Glad to have you here.

A *bit* about myself: I love **software applications** and the possibilities and capabilities they unlock for both users and developers to accomplish tasks, be productive, and _**create**_. My programming adventure began when I was **13**, kicking off things with the _easy-to-understand-but-a-bit-too-verbose_ **Java** programming language. Fast forward **4 years**, and Apple had introduced **Swift**, and I thought it was a good and clean opportunity to develop for **Apple platforms**. In a sense, the past **3 years** in my programming adventure have been rewarding, not only in the sense of gaining higher technical ability alone, but also the value and essence of working as a team and collaborating with effectiveness and efficiency. Beyond programming, I also enjoy video editing, and have been creating **anime music videos (AMVs)** for the last 3 years. You can find them on my **[YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/animemusicvideosx)**.

My professional profile is available on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayank-kumar-478245b1/)** if you were curious.

## Education
I am pursuing a **bachelor's degree (B.S.) in Computer Science** at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst** and it has been exciting so far. I may pursue a **master's degree (M.S.)** in the same field after graduation, or perhaps, if I have the opportunity, to work an interesting job in the industry. I love **self-learning**, and personally find that it is quite an efficient and effective means to learn. Online course catalogs such as **Udemy** and **Udacity** have been instrumental in my self-learning process.

## Experience
I have had the opportunity to intern as an **iOS Developer** at **Swisk Inc.** where I was responsible for developing the iOS version of their **Uber-like** application for ride-booking. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to assist my esteemed professor at my university as a **Teaching Assistant** for a **computer networking** course. I was responsible for weekly quizzes and developing problems for the course **midterm exam**. I do feel that I do not have amount of industry experience I would have hoped, but I also am happy that I utilized that time in honing my technical abilities through self-learning, as mentioned earlier.

## Projects
At the heart of every programmer's adventure are their projects, and some of mine are:
